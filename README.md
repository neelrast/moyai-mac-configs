# Mac Setup for Development

This repository contains a collection of configuration files and scripts for setting up a Mac development environment, tailored to my personal preferences. It includes configuration files for the VIM text editor, the Bash and Zsh shells, and Git, as well as a script to customize macOS defaults and install Homebrew packages.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mac-configs.git
```

Then, navigate to the cloned directory:

cd mac-configs
```

Now to setup various mac tools and configurations, run any script from the `scripts` directory:

```bash
cd scripts
```

```bash
# Replace <script-name> with the name of the script you want to run
./<script-name>.sh
```
